I. Adding the opal6-demos layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the opal6-demos layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the opal6-demos layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the opal6-demos layer to bblayers.conf, along with the 
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
	  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-python \
	  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-networking \
	  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-gnome \ 
	  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-xfce \ 
	  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-opal6-demos \
  "

Set your machine type to 'opal6dl'. Do this by editing the MACHINE variable in local.conf.
i.e.

  MACHINE ??= 'opal6dl'

II. Misc
========

The machine is configured to build kernel version 3.14.28.
There are 3 demo images available:

1) opal6-image-minimal
This is a bare minimum image which basically just lets the board boot.

2) opal6-image-xfce
This image provides all the components necessary to run the XFCE desktop.

3) opal6-image-base
A recommended starting point for developing custom images which will ensure all required
kernel modules and other components are included in the root filesystem.
